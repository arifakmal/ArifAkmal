# Hi there, I'm 'Arif Akmal 👋

A curious mind with a passion for cybersecurity, network defense, and all things infrastructure. Currently diving deep into cyber at Universiti Malaya, while bringing along years of real-world experience from roles in IT infrastructure and cloud operations (yep, I’ve been in the trenches).

From configuring firewalls to decoding packet captures, I thrive on building secure, resilient systems. 
I’ve worked with teams at Akamai, Sunway, and Hartalega — and now I’m translating that industry know-how into personal projects and open-source contributions.

🔐 Defender at heart.

🧠 Always learning.

🧭 Guided by integrity and ethics — because security without trust means nothing.

Let’s build a safer digital world, one commit at a time.
